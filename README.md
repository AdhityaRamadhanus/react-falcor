# React Falcor TodoMVC Example

## What is [Falcor](http://netflix.github.io/falcor)?

Falcor is the innovative data platform that powers the Netflix UIs. Falcor allows you to model all your backend data as a single Virtual JSON object on your Node server. On the client you work with your remote JSON object using familiar JavaScript operations like get, set, and call. If you know your data, you know your API.

## Running

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
